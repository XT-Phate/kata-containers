Background
I am a software engineer at Alibaba Cloud, engaged in operating system and cloud infrastructure related technologies. I have extensive development experience with Linux kernels, container image acceleration, Rust-based micro-virtual machines, and confidential containers. I have been working on software technologies related to Kata Containers since 2019 and have made many contributions to the Kata agent-rs/runtime-rs, Dragonball vmm and Nydus Image Service projects.

I am also one of the advocates of rustify Kata Containers. Over the past four years, I've helped rustifying Kata agent/runtime and Dragonball step by step. For my own personal interest, I like to refactor existing code to get better abstractions :) I've also put a lot of effort into getting Kata into production to support Function Computing, Container Services, Machine Learning/AI and database workloads.

Last year, I contributed to the community in the following ways:
1) Refactor the storage object management subsystem in Kata runtime/agent.
2) Help integrating Nydus Image Service into Dragonball vmm.
3) Reconstruct Cocoâ€™s image management system to help merging Coco into the Kata main branch.
4) Enhance Nydus image service to better support Coco.
5) Put Kata related technologies into production and have a huge deployment base

In the coming year, I plan to work with the community and focus on the following tasks:
1) Get runtime-rs ready for production
2) Get Dragonball ready for production
3) Better cooperation between Coco and Kata, mainly integrating Coco into the Kata main branch
4) Enhance Nydus Image Service to better support Kata
5) Enhance Dragonball to better support GPU, other accelerators and DPU.
