Background: 

I am a software engineer at NVIDIA, where I work on all things cloud-native. 
At NVIDIA I am leading the Kata and Confidential Containers efforts and enabling 
Kata and Confidential Containers on all of our architectures, platforms and 
projects, ranging from embedded, edge devices to data centers and cloud. 

Over the last two years, I have been actively involved in Kata, contributing
my expertise and dedication towards its success. As a passionate and experienced
professional in the field, I strongly believe that my skills and insights can
greatly benefit the AC's decision-making process.

Here are a few reasons why I believe I am well-suited for this role:

Extensive Technical Knowledge: With over ten years of experience in system 
software development/performance engineering and a strong background in
virtualization from embedded to cloud, I possess a deep understanding of the
technical aspects involved in our project. This knowledge allows me to provide
valuable input and contribute to informed discussions within the committee.

Additionally I have an broad experience and insight from various industry fields, 
ranging from robotics at the Fraunhofer Institute, automotive doing autonomous
parking at Mercedes Research to mainframe and blade servers at IBM to cloud and 
Kubernetes at RedHat and NVIDIA. 

Especially in Kata I have added the virtualization reference architecture to 
support advanced use-cases like GPUDirect RDMA and GPUDirect GDS which is a must
have for allmost all of the NVIDIA customers and internal projects leveraging
Kata. Last year I added proper support for GPU, vGPU time-sliced, 
vGPU MIG-backed and this year my focus was on the confidential GPU support. 

Last but not least my insights through my work at NVIDIA on Confidential 
Computing and AI/ML use-cases will help me as a member of the AC to help guide
the project to support important use-cases and requirements.

Strong Leadership Abilities: Throughout my career, I have demonstrated effective
leadership skills by successfully leading cross-functional teams and delivering
complex projects on time and within budget. My ability to collaborate with
diverse stakeholders ensures that decisions made by the committee align with
both technical requirements and overall project goals.

Commitment to Continuous Improvement: As a member of the AC, I will strive to
drive innovation and promote best practices within our project. By staying
up-to-date with emerging technologies and industry trends, I can help guide our
software towards greater efficiency, scalability, and user satisfaction.

Excellent Communication Skills: Effective communication is crucial for any
committee's success. With my strong verbal and written communication abilities,
I can facilitate productive discussions among committee members, ensuring that
ideas are shared openly and transparently.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute further to this project's
growth as a member of the AC. If given the chance, I will dedicate myself
wholeheartedly to fulfilling my responsibilities with utmost professionalism.

Thank you for considering my nomination. 
Mr. Z
