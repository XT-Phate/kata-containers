Background:

I am a Principal Software Engineer working for Intel, where I work on several
projects related to virtualization and containers: Kata Containers, rust-vmm
and Cloud Hypervisor.

I started to work on Kata Containers a few years ago, back when I initially led
the Clear Containers project at Intel. Since then I have contributed to many
different areas of the project, from core components like the virtcontainers
package to integration work with the CRI-O and containerd projects.

Together with the folks from hyper.sh, we began the Kata Containers journey
with the ambitious goal of providing stronger isolation to cloud native
workloads, with minimal overhead. Three years ago, this was a fairly innovative
approach and at some point I stopped counting the number of hours that Xu, Eric,
Peng or myself spent at conferences, meetups or foundation booths demonstrating
how Kata Containers met that promise. I believe it is now time to bring the next
generation of hardware isolation and confidentiality technologies to the cloud
native ecosystem, and in the upcoming months I'd like to help the Kata
Containers project reach that goal.
