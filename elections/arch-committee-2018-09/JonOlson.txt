Background:

I am a staff software engineer at Google working on the core virtualization and
I/O layer backing Google Compute Engine. My work is focused on resource
footprint minimization as well as performance optimization and stability. Part
of this work is improving our support for containerized workloads and ensuring
it is aligned with the needs of our customer community (e.g., Kata users).

My involvement with the Kata community has included being a regular attendee at
the weekly Kata Arch Council meetings. To these meetings Iâ€™ve brought context
from my work building and maintaining a hypervisor that supports long-lived
workloads at scale, as well as the occasional PR for getting Kata running in
GCE. I believe whole workload containment via virtualization is a key component
to addressing the broad problem of container security. Having a strong, open
solution to that problem is critical to ensuring all workloads can run
securely, regardless of where they are deployed.

I enjoy working with the Kata community to build such a solution, and look
forward to many more core-hours of security contained workloads.
