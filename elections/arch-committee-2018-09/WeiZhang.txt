Introduction:

I am now working as a Senior Engineer in Huawei Corporation,
leading a team which is responsible for providing container solutions based on
K8s/docker/kata-containers to other departments and Huawei Public Cloud. 

I was once a docker developer and now is an active kata contributor, and has been
Architecture Committee Member for about eight months. Kata Containers is a great
project which can help reduce some security concerns comparing to native container
solution, and I don't think I need more words to elaborate how great it is because
I believe all the readers of this file are familiar enough to Kata. :-)

So I wish to renew my seat, and do more work to help kata community
to make excellent open source project, and then make better product based on 
Kata to our customers.
