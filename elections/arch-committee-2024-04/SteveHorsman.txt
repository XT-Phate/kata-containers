Background:

I am a software engineer at IBM, where I work on Confidential Computing
based on Z mainframe technology.

I've been involved in the Kata Containers project since July 2021, when the
development in the Confidential Containers started. My main focus has been
working on the the CCv0 branch of kata-containers and tests, where I've helped
add new features, test code, jobs, done many code reviews, helped with the CoCo
release process and then helped to co-ordinate the migration of the CoCo
function into the main branch in a proper way. In the last year I've served on
the Architecture Committee.

I've also been involved in helping with the CI and updated release process
and I see my role going forwards to continue to be focused on the CoCo uses
of kata and try and help bring between the community and help with CI
stability and releases. I also look forward to some large changes in the near
future like moving to containerd 2.0 and the transition to runtime-rs.

Steve
