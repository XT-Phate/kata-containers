Background:

I am a staff engineer at Ant Group, where my primary focus is cloud-native
infrastructure-related technologies, including both container runtimes and
images.

I have been an active contributor since the foundation of Kata Containers
project back in 2017. I used to work on many areas of the project including
architectural design, development, releasing management, security auditing,
event organizing, and community promoting. I have served as a member of the
architecture committee since 2021 and would like to renew my seat to continue
my contribution to the community.

In the coming year, there are still quite a lot of interesting things going on
in the community, out of which my main focus would mostly be around:

1. Engaging more users. While Kata is getting more and more end users, it is
also obvious that we are not getting enough feedback from them. The latest end-user
survey is a good start. I would like to help engage more end users so
that we can use their feedback to prioritize features of the project.

2. Collaboration with the confidential container project. Coco is certainly one
of the most important downstream of Kata. While Coco has been doing great so far,
it has been living in the shadow for too long. We should merge it into the main
branch soonish and ensure the roadmap-wise longterm alignment of Coco and Kata.

3. PVM (Pagetable-based Virtual Machine) is a cutting-edge isolation technology
developed by Ant Group and expands Kata's usage in nested VM environments. It
is still in the process of being upstreamed in the Linux kernel community and I
would devote part of my time to help integrate and promote it in the Kata
community, especially to the SaaS/PaaS provider users of Kata who operate mostly
in public cloud.

Meanwhile, there is certainly more to do for the community and I look forward to
continuing to serve the community and help it thrive.

Cheers,
Bergwolf
