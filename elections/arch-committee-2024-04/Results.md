# Architecture Committee Election Results: Apr 2024

Four nominations were received for the April 2024 elections:

- [`Anastassios Nanos`](https://github.com/ananos)
- [`Steve Horsman`](https://github.com/stevenhorsman)
- [`Tao Peng`](https://github.com/bergwolf)
- [`Zvonko Kaiser`](https://github.com/zvonkok)

Four seats were available, and the architecture committee resulting from
the above nominations would not contain more than two members of the
same affiliation, so the voting phase was skipped and all the nominated
individuals were appointed to the architecture committee.

Congratulations to our new architecture committee members `Anastassios`
and `Zvonko`, and to our continuing members `Steve` and `Tao`!
