# Architecture Committee Election Results: Oct 2024

Four nominations were received for the October 2024 elections, however
one of the candidates withdrew before the voting period. The final
candidate list is:

- [`Aurelien Bombo`](https://github.com/sprt)
- [`Fupan Li`](https://github.com/lifupan)
- [`Greg Kurz`](https://github.com/gkurz)

Three seats were available, and the architecture committee resulting from
the above nominations would not contain more than two members of the
same affiliation, so the voting phase was skipped and all the nominated
individuals were appointed to the architecture committee.

Congratulations to our new architecture committee member `Aur√©lien`
and to our continuing members `Fupan` and `Greg`!
