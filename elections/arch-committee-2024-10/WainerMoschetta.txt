Background:

I am a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat. I work for the Openshift
Sandboxed Containers (OSC) project, which provides Kata Containers to the
Openshift Container Platform (OCP).

My first contribution to Kata Containers was merged in the old year of 2020,
when I was assigned to ensure the project was tested on OCP. Since then I've
contributed to diverse areas like CI, testing, build and releases. Sometimes I
even review pull requests for features, where usually I'm more concerned about
tests and CI integration, I confess. I'm proud to have ran initiatives to
aggregates many developers around the purpose of improving the workflow of the
Kata community, for example, "Always green CI", "Tailorbird Initiative" and
"CoCo CI meetings". Talking about CoCo, I worked with Steve Horsman to implement
the minimum required CI for CCv0 branch, then recently when we had to merge that
branch into 'main' I was involved too.

My goal in Kata Containers Architecture Committee will be to leverage the
knowledge that I acquired over the years to advice on the next project
decisions. I also would like to see a community more engaging and bringing
topics to AC.

Regards,

Wainer
