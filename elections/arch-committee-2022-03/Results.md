# Architecture Committee Election Results: March 2022

Two nominations were received for the March 2022 elections:

- [`Peng Tao`](https://github.com/bergwolf)
- [`Samuel Ortiz`](https://github.com/sameo)

Two seats were available, so elections were over sooner.

The two members were (re-)admitted to the Architecture Committee on 2021-03-16
for another 12 month term.
