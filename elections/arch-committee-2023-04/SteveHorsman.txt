Background:

I am a software engineer at IBM, where I work on Confidential Computing and
Cloud Platforms based on Z mainframe technology.

I've been involved in the Kata Containers project since July 2021, when the 
development in the Confidential Containers started. My main focus has been
working on the the CCv0 branch of kata-containers and tests, where I've helped
add new features, test code, jobs, done many code reviews, helped with the CoCo
release process and be one of the maintainers of the CCv0 branch to keep it 
synced up with the main branch.

My focus going forward is to help be part of the bridge between the Kata
Containers and Confidential Containers and work on how we can integrate
the new Confidential Containers code into the main branch of Kata Containers
in a way that adds value, and doesn't significantly compromise the existing
users in performance, or stability.

I also want to help be a part of improving the performance and reliability of
the CI/CD process after having a lot of first hand experience of some of the 
challenges developers and reviewer can face trying to get new PRs tested and
integrated.
