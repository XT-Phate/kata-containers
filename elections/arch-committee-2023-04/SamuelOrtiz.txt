Background:

I am a software engineer at Rivos, where I work on container, virtualization and
confidential computing related projects.

A few years ago, together with Hyper and the OpenStack Foundation, we created
the Kata Containers project. I've really enjoyed seeing it growing into a wide,
cross-industry project with such a large customer base. Over those years, I
actively contributed to many parts of the project and tried to make the Kata
community both a welcoming and technologically innovative place.

A couple of years ago, together with some other Kata contributors, we started to
build a new project with the goal of making a fairly complex and new technology,
Confidential Computing, seamlessly accessible through the canonical cloud native
software stack: Kubernetes and its flourishing ecosystem. Kata Containers was
the obvious choice and an almost perfect fit as the foundation for the
Confidential Containers project, and it proves to be a very solid base. As both
a Confidential and Kata Containers contributor and community member, I want to
continue reinforcing the symbiosis that we created between those 2 projects. I
believe that renewing my AC member seat would allow me to continue helping those
2 projects benefiting from each others, and this what I intend to focus on for
the upcoming year.

Cheers,
Samuel
