Background:

I am a staff engineer at Ant Group, where my primary focus is cloud-native
infrastructure-related technologies, including both container runtimes and
images.

I have been an active member of the Kata Containers community since 2017.
I worked on many areas of the project, including architectural design,
development, releasing management, security auditing, event organizing, and
community promoting. I've been part of the architecture Committee since 2021,
and I'd be honored to continue serving the community.

In the past years, the community has done tremendous work to bring a fast,
secure and production-ready container runtime to the world. In the coming year,
my main focus will mostly be around:

1. runtime-rs maturity and adoption. We've been developing runtime-rs for
quite some time. It is faster, more stable, and more memory efficient. It is
now time to look at a realistic timeline to make it default and share it with
a wider range of Kata Containers users.

2. PVM (Pagetable-based Virtual Machine) is a cutting-edge isolation technology
developed by Ant Group and expands Kata's usage in nested VM environments by
removing the nested VT hardware requirement. While it is still in the process
of being upstreamed in the Linux kernel community, we've been deploying it on
a large scale internally, and there are community users around as well. I'd like
to help integrate and promote it both in the Kata community and in the wider
kernel community.

I sincerely look forward to continuing to serve the Kata community and helping
it thrives.

Cheers,
Bergwolf
