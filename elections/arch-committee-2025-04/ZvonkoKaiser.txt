Background:

I would be honored to continue serving on the Architecture Committee and further
contribute to our shared goals. I am a principal engineer at NVIDIA, focusing on
cloud-native development and leading Kata and Confidential Containers efforts
across various architectures—from embedded and edge devices to data centers and
cloud platforms. Over the last four years, I’ve been deeply involved in Kata,
bringing my expertise and dedication to help it flourish.

Throughout my career, I’ve gained extensive technical knowledge in system
software development, performance engineering, and virtualization—experience
that spans robotics at the Fraunhofer Institute, automotive research at
Mercedes, mainframe and blade servers at IBM, and cloud/Kubernetes roles at
RedHat and NVIDIA. In Kata, I helped introduce the virtualization reference
architecture to support advanced GPU use cases like GPUDirect RDMA and GPUDirect
GDS. I also added GPU, vGPU (time-sliced and MIG-backed) support, and recently
focused on confidential GPU capabilities. All of these efforts have aimed to
expand Kata’s features and better serve the wider community.

Collaboration and teamwork are at the heart of my approach. I have led
cross-functional teams and worked with diverse stakeholders to ensure open
communication and consensus-driven decisions. I stay up-to-date with emerging
technologies and industry trends, continually seeking ways to enhance
efficiency, scalability, and user satisfaction in our projects.

Looking ahead, I am excited to help guide our work into the secure AI era. By
strengthening confidential computing, advancing GPU virtualization technologies,
and aligning with robust security standards, I believe we can ensure that our
project remains at the forefront of modern AI use cases—empowering developers
and users alike with trusted, scalable solutions.

If given the opportunity, I will continue promoting innovation, community
engagement, and transparency within the Architecture Committee. Thank you for
considering my nomination, and I look forward to helping guide our work to even
greater success.

Sincerely,
Mr. Z
