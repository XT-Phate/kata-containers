Background:

I am a software engineer at IBM, where I work on Confidential Computing
based on Z mainframe technology.

I've been involved in the Kata Containers project since July 2021, when the
development in the Confidential Containers started. My main focus has been
working on CoCo features, CI and helping with the Kata Containers releases.
In the last two years I've served on the Architecture Committee.

Some of the activities that I'm keen to help drive in the next year are:
- Helping onboard new members and platforms to the community
- Trying to help drive more "professional" standards in kata-containers,
like regularly running security scans, ensuring our crates and modules are
kept up-to-date and driving our CVE backlog down
- Helping to improve our CI process and get faster and more targeted testing

I'm also looking forward to seeing what happens with the move to containerd 2.0
and with runtime-rs enhancements.

Steve
