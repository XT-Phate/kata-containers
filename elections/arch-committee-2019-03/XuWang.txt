Background:

I am the CTO of hyper.sh, leading the Hyper team contributing to Kata Containers and related communities.
Before Kata, our team and I worked on runV, which is one of the predecessors of Kata Containers. It was 
my great honor to involve the creating of the Kata Containers project and became a initial member of 
the Architecture Committee together with Samual Ortiz. 

After having Kata Containers announced, more and more people began to consider the container security as
a solvable problem and several open source secure container runtime projects were released in the past
year. And Kata Containers is becoming the de facto standard: we have had better integration with containerd
via shimv2, and the better CRI-O integration is on its way; we have had more hypervisors support, such as
firecracker and NEMU.

For me, I focused on kubernetes integration efficiency and boot-time related topics in the past months, and
had an eye on runtime benchmarks, multi-architecture support as well. In the future, I will pay more attention
to both the runtime development and the documentation to help users to adopt Kata Containers.
