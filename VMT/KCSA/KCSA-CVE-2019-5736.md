reproduce:
  - Exploit does not effect Kata Containers.

notes:
  - The CVE-2019-5736 does not affect Kata Containers. Kata Containers does use the
    runc libcontainer library as part of its `kata-agent` to launch container workloads, but
    the `kata-agent` executable is a permanently running application within the Kata Containers
    VM. Thus, the exit/re-execute cycle utilised by CVE-2019-5736 to execute the injected code
    is never undertaken.
  - It should be noted, if the exploit had escaped from the `kata-agent`, the exploit code
    would have been executing inside the Kata Containers VM as root, and would not have direct
    access to either the host system or other container/pods.
  - It is highly likely Kata Containers will vendor in and adopt all relevant libcontainer updates
    and changes, but given the "copying" nature of some fixes, a performance and resource impact
    review will be undertaken.
